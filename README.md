![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvpstack/helpin/main/dashboard-preview.png)

## Demo

You can test client side here â†’ https://support.helpin.so & just signup with real email address.

## How to setup on vercel

Currently to setup this software is tricky because of supbase clone is hard. So, if you reall wanna use this for your company then block a 30 minute video call with me to setup for your for free.
